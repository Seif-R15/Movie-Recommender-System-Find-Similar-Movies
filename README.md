A movie recommender system built using Spark SQL, which provides recommendations for similar movies based on user preferences and collaborative filtering techniques. The system leverages the power of Spark's distributed computing framework to handle large-scale datasets efficiently.

## Features
- Collaborative filtering: The system utilizes collaborative filtering algorithms to identify similar movies based on user ratings and preferences.
- Spark SQL integration: Spark SQL is used to perform efficient data processing and querying, enabling faster and scalable recommendations.
- User preferences: Users can provide their movie preferences, such as genres, actors, or ratings, to receive personalized movie recommendations.
- Large-scale dataset support: The system is designed to handle large-scale movie datasets, allowing it to scale and provide accurate recommendations even with extensive data.
- Data visualization: The project includes visualizations of movie ratings, genre distributions, and user preferences using Spark SQL's data visualization capabilities.
